Mercari is a safe and easy online marketplace for buying and selling clothing, electronics, 
household goods, specialty items, and more. They made a Kaggle competition to solve one of their 
business problems which is finding optimal price point for items on sale. This is very important since 
optimal price point attracts more customers to your website and results a faster transaction. 
Mercari business model is based on transaction fees, which means their earnings are connected to 
the number of items sold. Finding the optimal price point helps to attract more sellers and customers 
and to boost the volumes in selling
